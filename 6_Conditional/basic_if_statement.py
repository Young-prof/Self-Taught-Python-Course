'''
The following code loops through a list of car names and looks for the value 'bmw'. Whenever the value is 'bmw', it’s printed in uppercase instead of title case:
'''
cars = ['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
for car in cars:
    if car == 'bmw':
        print(car.upper())
else:
    print(car.title())
