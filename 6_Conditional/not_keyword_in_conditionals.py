Checking Whether a Value is "Not" in a List
Other times, itâ€™s important to know if a value does not appear in a list. You can use the keyword not in this situation. For example, consider a list of users who are banned from commenting in a forum. You can check whether a user has been banned before allowing that person to submit a comment:
'''
banned_users = ['andrew', 'carolina', 'david']
user = 'marie'
if user not in banned_users:
    print(f"{user.title()}, You can post a response if you wish")
else:
    print(f"{user.title()}, you're banned from posting in this platform")
