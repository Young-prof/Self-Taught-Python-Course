# Now, we shouldn'nt be confused with the fact that initially we called added the reverse=true in side the sort function. You only do that when you want to sort and reverse at the same time

print('Original List here:')

print(cars)  # Original List
print('\nReversed List:')
cars.reverse()  # Reversed List
print(cars)
