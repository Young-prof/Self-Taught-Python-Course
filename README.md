This is More like a Documentary or should i say Progress Track on My Python Journey.

The Repository contains all the Example codes for each Topic in Python Programming and
sum basic Challenges or problems to strengthen My Python Programming Skills.

Is it easy to Read and Understand, Because All topics are arranged in some sort of a chronological other.

Each chapter contains it's examples and challenges.

Problems or challenges are named with challenge. As in challenge1.py and so on.

I used Visual Studio Code as my Text Editor because it is my Favorite, however, if you choose to use Vscode for python for the first time, you'll Struggle with installing external Modules.
Feel Free to email me or through any means of your choice to work you through it. With time i'll make a detailed explanation on how to go about it. It's nothing big, you just need to create an venv file and had the path.

Another potential Error you might encounter, Note that this is common in almost all text editors. You'll have an error like this "Another git process seems to be running in this repository" just copy the venv file you created and add it to the .git folder and you're just one step away from becomming a python Developer.
